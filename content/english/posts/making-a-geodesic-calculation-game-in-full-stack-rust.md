I have been playing https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/ and https://globle-game.com/game recently and have been enjoying it. However, I really want a tool to help me guess distances between two points on Earth, i.e. find the [geodesic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodesic). In particular the focus should be on places on Earth, most likely on land.


# Background

The Earth is not a perfect sphere, therefore a ellipsodi appxoimates is more representative.

## Earth Related simplications

## Limitations
