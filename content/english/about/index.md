The idea behind this site is to [learn generously](https://www.recurse.com/self-directives#learn-generously). The focus will largely be on Computer Science (CS) related topics. However, expect anything.


# About Me

I had a diverse tri-lingual upbringing, growing up halfway across the world from my extended family, and have lived in 6-7 countries. 
I have been programming (starting with Python) for over 10 years now, I even did some simple professional programming before university. I did a degree in Aerospace Engineering before coming back to CS at university. However, I had a formal discrete mathematics education before university. So my formal CS education is very non-linear :).


Currently, I am learning/getting better at:

* Cryptography
* Rust

# Hobbies

* Doing Sports: Basketball, Association Football, Cycling - I am also into sports analytics and even wrote a small book (57 pages) on a statistical analysis of successful NBA Teams 
 between grades 9 and 10. I also have attended the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference twice.
* Rubik's Cube and similar puzzles (I even competed in [some WCA competition](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2016PENA14) and have done [Blind](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vn82TCl8VgY))
* Tetris ([jstris](https://jstris.jezevec10.com/replay/68713051))
* Reading
* Visiting libraries - I have been to 8 national libraries (one of them was even a UNESCO world heritage site, guess it without googling it) in the last 4 years
* Cartography and History - with a particular focus on regions I have connections to. One of my favorite books is [From Third World to First: the Singapore Story, 1965-2000](https://www.worldcat.org/title/from-third-world-to-first-the-singapore-story-1965-2000/oclc/44468763).
